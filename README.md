# How I Became A Software Engineer

This is my learning journey

## 2020.11.05
I'm working on the Google Power searching course. In my own time I'm trying to make myself more familiar with computer + website shortcuts. So far I'm learning gmail shortcuts, CopyQ shortcuts, and browser shortcuts! 
### Gmail
Learning how to compose messages, add BCC, and send messages. I'm trying to use my mouse as little as possible (it just saves me so much time)
### Browser
Learning how to switch tabs + windows
### Google Power Search
So far I'm on the second module. I'm really interested to learn how to image search. The implications of this feature astound me! I could image search mushrooms or poisonous plants! Wow!

So far I have learned about advanced search operators, how to type 50 WPM, deliberate practice, the benefits of shortcuts and gitlab flavored Markdowns. All of these skills will help me in my journey of becoming a Software Engineer. I learned that my tasks are going to be assigned to me, but they will not contain instructions on how to do the task (that is for me to figure out). I also learned that this is the format that replicates the "real world" experience. I will be assigned issues, and it will be my job to solve those issues!

I figured out how to change the settings on gitlab. 

I also am learing about advanced search operators! Things like intitle: , inurl:, intext:, Filetype:.

search?q = query

## 2020.10.31
I'm really stuck on how to disable some features in gitlab, and to create numbered lists. I'm becoming more familiar with how to navigate gitlab. So that is a plus!

Today we (Elijah and I) learned how to use Screen

I learned how to use gitlab shortcuts using (https://www.shortcutfoo.com/) [(this website]
## 2020.10.20
I learned how to type 50 WPM using (www.typing.io) [this website]

I read Peak, and wrote a review of what I learned in that book.

## Review

## What I Learned From Peak


1. ### I learned so much from Peak!
- I learned that no one is just "born with a gift". That true heroes are made with deliberate practice. I learned that deliberate practice is done by making mental representations while you learn (not just plain repetition). You have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and stay there, to really level up your skill. If you practice a task that is "too easy" you are not challenging your brain to learn. Once I feel like I'm "uncomfortable" then I know that I'm on the path of learning!

2. ### I learned that mentors/teachers play a huge role in learning.
- If I want to learn most efficiently, then I need to find someone who is excellent in their field (Elijah) and study/practice how they practiced! people who are "good at their craft" aren't necessarily " good teachers", so I'm happy that I lucked out with Elijah

3. ### Learning comes in steps.
- By accomplishing one step, I give feedback to my brain that I'm learning (good job). As the steps get more and more difficult, I still have that immediate feedback of "work on this/good job on that"

4. ### I learned about the corpus callosum
 - (which is an organ that I deal with at my current job).

5. ### In summary
- Intensely practice for at least 1 hour while making mental representations (push yourself), find a great teacher, and repeat this process until you've learned the skill!
